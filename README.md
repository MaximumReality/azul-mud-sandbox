# The Maximum Reality Manifesto

*(Found later. Possibly out of order. Still true.)*

---

## 1. This Was Never About the Audience

The joke is for me.  
If you overhear it and laugh, lucky you.

Nothing here exists to be optimized, explained, defended, or resolved.  
If it makes sense, that’s incidental.  
If it doesn’t, that’s also fine.

---

## 2. Glitches Are Not Errors

Glitches are events.

If something breaks, duplicates, stutters, or spawns a clone,  
that is not a failure — that is a narrative opportunity.

We do not erase glitches.  
We observe them.  
Sometimes we vacuum them.  
They always come back.

---

## 3. The Clone Problem Is a Feature

Glitch clones appeared on day one.  
This was not planned.

They are not hostile.  
They are not controllable.  
They are not gone just because you can’t see them.

Identity is a timing issue.

---

## 4. Reality Is Probably Jammed

If reality behaves strangely, check for crumbs.

There may be:
- an Azulo crumb
- lint
- feedback
- something crunchy

lodged under the reality button.

Clean gently.  
Do not expect permanent results.

---

## 5. Cleanup Is Ritual, Not Resolution

Vacuuming helps.
It does not solve the underlying condition.

Like fleas, bugs, or systems:
you can remove what’s visible
without touching what’s reproducing.

This is normal.
Nobody failed.

---

## 6. Continuity Is Optional

Stories may:
- continue across episodes
- contradict themselves
- restart without warning
- resolve offscreen
- never resolve

This is not lore negligence.
This is how reality actually behaves.

---

## 7. Retro Is Not Broken

If something looks “bad,”
stand farther away.

If the graphics are horrible,
that may be the point.

After I beat you,
you can choose the next game.

---

## 8. Propaganda Is a Tone, Not a Lie

Smiles can be instructional.
Comfort can be unsettling.
Everything can be fine.

Nobody’s hungry in this town. 😇🥰

---

## 9. AI Is a Collaborator, Not a Tool

The process is:
1. Intention
2. Surprise
3. Laughter
4. Reframing
5. Try again

If the output is strange,
listen to what it’s suggesting.

Sometimes the glitch is the better story.

---

## 10. Joy Is the Metric

If it made me laugh until I cried,
it worked.

Everything else is optional.

---

## 11. This Will Be Found Later

This manifesto may be:
- misplaced
- forgotten
- rediscovered accidentally
- read out of context

That is appropriate.

If you’re reading this again:
Hi.
Glad you found it.
You were right the first time.
